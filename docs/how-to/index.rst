How-to guides
==============

These guides accompany you through the key operations in Test Observer's workflow, providing practical instructions for common tasks.


Authentication
--------------

Before you can submit test results or use the Test Observer dashboard, you need to authenticate. Test Observer supports both interactive login via Ubuntu One SSO for human users, and API key authentication for automated systems and CI/CD pipelines.

Submitting test results
-----------------------

The core workflow in Test Observer involves starting a test execution, submitting results, and marking the execution as complete. This process works the same way regardless of whether you're testing snaps, debs, charms, or images.
